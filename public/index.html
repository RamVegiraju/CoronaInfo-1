            On March 11th, 2020, the World Heath Ogranization declared the
            CoronaVirus a pandemic. An estimated 114,000 peple contracted the
            virus in 114 various countries by then. As of March 29, 2020, Over
            720,000 cases have been reported in 177 countries. The virus will
            not stop spreading anytime soon and current actions, especially in
            the United States, have been futile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coronavirus, more specifically COVID-19, is a respitory disease
            caused by a novel coronavirus. This specific coronavirus does not
            cause death to the majority of people with an estimated death rate
            between one to three percent. However, the Kaiser Family Foundation
            released a statistic stating that about 100 million of american
            adults are at risk for serious illness. Because of the virus's
            ability to spread through miniscule droplets, the threat is
            definately a reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on current efforts, it seems that the virus is going to
            exponentially spread for at least the next few weeks. This can
            partially be illustrated by the pie chart below. What was once
            predominantly in China, is now most prominant in the United States.
            For this reason, we wanted to focus on predicting the sriousness of
            the situation and attempt to predict the amount of cases that can
            potentially arise. These efforts can benefit the government and
            Hospitals by approximating how many resources they will need.

            Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a virus that was 
            identified in 2003 that attacks the respiratory system. It 
            affected 26 countries with over 8000 cases and 774 deaths. Most
             cases of human-to-human transmission occurred in the health 
             care setting, in the absence of adequate infection control 
             precautions. Implementation of appropriate infection control
              practices brought the global outbreak to an end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a virus that was 
            identified in 2012 and has since spread to several other 
            countries. It is a type of coronavirus that affects the 
            respiratory system. MERS affected 27 countries with over 2400 
            cases and 858 deaths. Limited, non-sustained human-to-human 
            transmission mainly in health care  settings continues to occur.
             The risk of exported cases to other areas other than the
              Middle East remains significant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new coronavirus seems to be less deadly than SARS and MERS, 
            which killed around 10% and 35% of people who became infected,
            respectively. The new coronavirus is structurally similar to 
            SARS, with the two viruses sharing about 80 percent of their 
            genomes.

                  Although COVID-19 hasn't had as much time to develop as SARS yet there are many 
                  similarities in the timeline of confirmed cases.The exponential growth of COVID-19 
                  cases so far is similar to the first 3 months of SARS. The only difference is the
                  amount of SARS cases plateaued and COVID-19 cases is still rising, most likely due 
                  to the fact that the scale of COVID-19 is much higher.

                    The exponential growth of the deaths due to COVID-19 so far is very similar 
                    to the growth of SARS deaths in the first 3 months of its life. The amount of 
                    SARS deaths, however, seems to have plateaued while the amount of COVID-19 cases
                    is still growing due to the mass scale of the pandemic.

                    The growth of the of the amount of recoveries from COVID-19 is very similar to that
                    of SARS in its first 3 months, but it is expected to continue growing. SARS plateaued
                    because it was controlled at a significantly smaller size while the amount of COVID-19
                    cases is on a completely different scale.

                    MERS had an exponential growth in cases when it first appeared in 2012 and its 
                    growth in cases is very similar to that of SARS and COVID-19 but it is not 
                    comparable to either because of how widespread COVID-19 and SARS are compared to
                    it. MERS is not a good disease to compare COVID-19 to because it was predominant
                    in mainly Saudi Arabia and wasn't nearly as widespread as SARS. The similar
                    qualities between SARS and COVID-19 made these two diseases better to compare.

            We built off of OLS regression and developed an exponential regression 
            model. Pandemics in their first stage tend to have exponential growth, 
            thus our model traced the test data very well, however in regards to 
            future forecasts, it may not be able to accurately predict the growth 
            as the model remains exponential and may not be able to account for any 
            changes in the world in regards to COVID-19. Despite this, the model 
            performed extremely well in regards to tracking the first few months of 
            COVID and could be used with many other pandemics in their initial stages.
